WHAT DOES IT DO?

it opens a random page from hak5.org every 5 minutes

HOW DOES IT WORK?

the first 4 lines just changes the led and attackmode and runs the cucumbermode so it dosent overheat

the lines from 6 to 69 is just what runs the diffrent pages like what the name is what every line starts with and so on and so on

the line from 71 to 76 just runs RUN and types the page

and the last 3 lines is just a delay for 5 minutes and changes the led thats it
